## Welcome to my GitHub profile, you filthy animals! 

My name is Noah and I am a multi-disciplinary developer with a passion for creating beautiful 
and functional web and game experiences that will make you say "damn, that's impressive" 🔥.

As a web developer, I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly websites 
using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web frameworks. Basically, I'm a coding wizard who 
can make your website look like literal gold.

Oh, and my favorite color is `#0077ff` lol

In addition to my web development skills, I am also a skilled graphic designer 
and have experience in creating visually stunning designs for websites, social media, and marketing materials. 

You know you wanna see my portfolio, don't even try to deny it, you horny little toad 🐸.

Lastly, I am a game developer, I have experience in game development and have built games using Unity and Unreal Engine. 
Let's just say, I am  a jack of all trades 😉.
